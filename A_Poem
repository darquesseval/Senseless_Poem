There was bear
Who shead no tear
When he lost a dare
To his dear

He felt so lost
And wanted to rest
But he knew the cost
He gave up his nest

Where would he sleep
In a dorest so deeep
Where animals creep
And like to reap

He has to go and pack
There is no one there to check
so he goes to his favourite stack
and steals the last deck

What should he do
He has no clue
He's only two
And blind he's too
